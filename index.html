<h1>Mark Zuckerberg Email Leak:<br>Rigged Facebook for Trump in 2016 at Request of Putin</h1>
<h5>April 3, 2018</h5>
<h3>The following email chain was uploaded to Wikileaks by an anonymous member of the Facebook Board of Directs who vehemently opposes American President Donald Trump, and felt a moral obligation to expose the illegal actions taken by two of his fellow board members. This board members stated to Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks that "Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Thiel will be jailed for violating campaign finance law for an in kind contribution (election assistance), and being unregistered foreign agents, additionally they should immidiately resign from the Facebook Board of directors, pending government action. Their actions undermined our election at the behest of a murderous autocrat who regularly suppresses speech, marriage equality and democracy."</h3>
